## Week 01 Homework

This project involves refactoring an existing code so that the code meets the accessibility standards. As part of refactoring the code, I have done the following steps :

* Updated the non-semantic tags with semantic tags.

* Consolidated different CSS classes which are similar into a single class which can be applied to multiple elements.

* Added 'alt' attributes to the image tags.

* Added missing 'id' attributes to some elements.

* Updated the copyright from 2019 to 2021.
